# mMath
This is a library born to facilitate the math operation that riggers (but not only) have to do on daily basis while building rigs. 
Maya doesn’t provide out of the box with the regular maya commands pure vector operations (only trough OpenMaya, that most riggers don’t know/use) and also doing simple math operation with nodes gets really tedious. This library aims to provide a set of tools to simplify all that, the main goal is to have a pure math library that works in a friendly way with maya and a “mirrored” library that does the same thing operating with nodes. 
By changing few bits of the code the coder should be albe to jump from a pure math implementation to the corresponding node implementation.

The project is opensource so fill free to comment and partecipate to the project.

Currently only basic vector operation are supported, feel free to let me know what operations you need, aslo I will start working on some matrix operations that can be usefull.

Please feel free to give feedbacks so that the project can grow.

Here you can find the full documentation of the library with tutorials
on how to get started on using it:
